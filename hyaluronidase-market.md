<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hyaluronidase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Animal-derived Hyaluronidase</li><li>Synthetic Hyaluronidase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hyaluronidase market comprises two main types: animal-derived and synthetic hyaluronidase. Animal-derived hyaluronidase is extracted from tissues of animals, commonly used in medical and cosmetic applications, providing natural enzymatic activity. Synthetic hyaluronidase, on the other hand, is chemically produced to offer standardized formulations with consistent quality and potentially fewer immunogenic reactions. Both types are utilized for their ability to enhance the absorption of other substances, making them valuable in treatments such as ophthalmic procedures and dermal fillers.</p></p>
