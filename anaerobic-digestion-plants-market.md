<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaerobic Digestion Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mesophilic Digestion</li><li>Thermophilic Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anaerobic digestion plants utilize microorganisms to break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas. The market is primarily segmented into mesophilic and thermophilic digestion. Mesophilic digestion operates at moderate temperatures (around 30-40°C), offering stability and lower energy requirements, making it suitable for a variety of feedstocks. In contrast, thermophilic digestion occurs at higher temperatures (around 50-60°C), resulting in faster digestion rates and increased biogas yields, ideal for high-solid waste materials. Both types enhance waste management and renewable energy generation.</p></p>
